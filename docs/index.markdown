# Build beautiful, modern Network Systems from Keywords with KNA

KNA is a simple, modular tool written in Python designed to explore the relationships between keywords and identify communities within a network, providing insights into trending topics and their interconnections. KNA takes your keywords, fetches relevant posts from a social media platform (e.g., Bluesky) citing that keyword, constructs a co-occurrence network, and provides various analysis and visualization options.

KNA is an engine you can use to construct and analyze keyword networks from social media data, and visualize the results using different tools and formats. For example, you can use KNA in combination with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create dynamic reports, or with [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to create interactive network visualizations.
