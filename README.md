# Complex Systems Project

## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing co-occurrence networks of keywords extracted from posts on the Bluesky social media platform. It collects data using the Bluesky API, constructs a network graph based on keyword co-occurrences, computes various network metrics, and visualizes the results.

The aim is to explore the relationships between keywords and identify communities within the network, providing insights into trending topics and their interconnections.


## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

### Key Files

#### Configuration

**config.py** contains all configuration parameters for the co-occurrence analysis, including API credentials, keywords, and output settings. Modify these parameters to customize the analysis.

#### Entry Point

**main.py** is the application entry point. Run this file to execute the complete workflow: data collection, co-occurrence analysis, graph generation, and metrics computation.

#### Graph Operations

**graph.py** implements the network graph data structure and analysis using NetworkX. This module handles graph construction, metric calculations, and community detection.

## Outputs

All generated files are saved in the `exports/` directory. Key outputs include:

- `bluesky_posts_complex.csv`: Collected posts from Bluesky.
- `keyword_network.graphml`: Graph in GraphML format for Gephi.
- `community_assignments.csv`: Community detection results.
- `global_metrics.csv`: Global network metrics.
- `node_metrics.csv`: Per-node metrics (degree, centrality, etc.).
- `keyword_network.png`: Network visualization (spring layout).
- `keyword_network_circular.png`: Network visualization (circular layout).
- `network_metrics.png`: Histograms of network metrics.
- `grafo.xlsx`: Co-occurrence matrix spreadsheet.

## Example Usage: Climate Change Co-occurrence Network Analysis

The output files in the `exports/` directory are generated by running the application with climate-change related keywords.

### Analysis Workflow

**Data Collection** → Posts are fetched from Bluesky API filtered by 25 climate keywords including Energy Transition, CO₂, Global Warming, Renewable Energy, Biodiversity, Fossil Fuels, and more (case-insensitive matching).

The keywords are defined in `config.py`:

```python
KEYWORDS = [
    "Climate Change", "Global Warming", "Sustainability", "Renewable Energy",
    "Carbon Footprint", "Greenhouse Gases", "Fossil Fuels", "Deforestation",
    "Biodiversity", "Emissions", "Climate Action", "Environmental Policy",
    "Clean Energy", "Climate Crisis", "Sea Level Rise", "Extreme Weather",
    "Solar Power", "Wind Energy", "Energy Transition", "Climate Justice",
    "Carbon Neutral", "Reforestation", "Sustainable Development",
    "Climate Adaptation", "Ocean Acidification"
]
```

Locations are filtered to include only English-speaking countries to refine the analysis. These locations are specified in the `config.py` file:

```python
LOCATION_KEYWORDS = ["california", "quebec", "norway"]
```

**Co-occurrence Analysis** → For each post, the script counts which keyword pairs appear together. For example, if a post mentions both "Renewable Energy" and "Emissions," that co-occurrence is logged and weighted.

**Network Building** → Keywords become nodes; edges connect pairs that co-occur, weighted by frequency. Strong connections indicate keywords that tend to be discussed together in climate discourse.

### Key Outcomes

The analysis reveals the semantic landscape of climate discussions:

- **`keyword_network_edges.txt`**: Shows co-occurrence frequencies (e.g., "Renewable Energy" ↔ "Emissions" appearing together X times)
- **`node_metrics.csv`**: Reveals central keywords:
  - High degree = frequently co-occurring with many other terms
  - High betweenness = bridge between different climate topics
  - High closeness = central to overall discussion network
- **`community_assignments.csv`**: Groups related keywords into thematic clusters (e.g., "Fossil Fuels," "Deforestation," "Emissions" might form a cluster around environmental impact)
- **Network visualizations**: Visual maps showing how climate concepts interconnect

### Interpretation Example

If "Global Warming" has high betweenness centrality, it bridges discussions between mitigation topics (Renewable Energy, Green Policies) and impact topics (Glaciers, Extreme weather events)—making it a central connecting concept in climate conversations on social media.
